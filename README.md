The plugin allows uploading to a Moodle course, in its first version, three types of content created with Ardora: interactive activities, activity packs and web spaces.

By means of this plugin, teachers and students will have a detailed report of the work done, including data such as date, start and end time, activities correctly solved, number of incorrect answers, number of accesses or score obtained.

The teacher can obtain this report for all the students enrolled in a course while the students can only consult their own data.
